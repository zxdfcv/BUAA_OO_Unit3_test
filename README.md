# BUAA_OO_Unit3_test

This is the unit 3's test bat of the OO course.

## How to use

Put the jars in the same directory of the python files, and use IDEA to open the corresponding directory, then click the running button.

Check whether the two jars have the same output, and debug your (or the other's) program.

Enjoy debugging with your friends!!!
